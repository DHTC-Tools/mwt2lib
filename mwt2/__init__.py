'''mwt2lib is a Python library implementing a variety of tools,
mechanics, utilities, and interfaces that are useful to the US ATLAS
Midwest Tier 2 facility.  It is a work in progress, and not yet
versioned apart from the changeset IDs in the versioning repositories.

You can find mwt2lib here:
https://github.com/DHTC-Tools/mwt2lib
https://bitbucket.org/dhtc-tools/mwt2lib

The Github repo is primary, but the two are synchronized at least
daily.
